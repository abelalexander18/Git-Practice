The term "football" refers to multiple team sports played with a ball, most commonly association football (soccer) and American football, depending on the region. The games differ fundamentally in how the ball is handled and the rules of play. Association football, the world's most popular sport, involves two teams of 11 players who primarily use their feet to kick a round ball into the opponent's net to score. American football, popular in the United States, is played with an oval-shaped ball that players advance by running or throwing to score touchdowns, with play governed by a set number of downs to gain yardage
